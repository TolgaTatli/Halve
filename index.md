# About Me

Hi, my name is Preet, and I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest! I have been in the restaurant industry as both an owner and manager for about the past 15 years. I have always had a passion for technology, so I decided to pivot and learn to program.

I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp, a 19 week programming immersive school that teaches novices how to program and build rich and robust web applications.
